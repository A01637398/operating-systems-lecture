# operating-systems-lecture

Workshops and labs for ITESM operating system lecture

This is a template for a operating system lectures ITESM GDL
in order to increase the level of knowledge on the undergraduate students of computer science careers. 
This is plan to be deliverable in a period of time of 4 to 6 months. 
It is adjustable  in time and order; however the expectations and basic topics should keep the essence of the plan.
